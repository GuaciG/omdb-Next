# Movie App with Nextjs 15, Tailwindcss and deployed on Vercel

A very easy to use app where you can search for movies using a search engine. Type any word that contains the title and hit search. All movies related to that word will appear.

## Onboarding 

When you visit this page for the first time, an overlay with instructions for use will show. Close this window and it will not appear again in the future.
